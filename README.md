This includes macros, the users' guide and example programs.

DISCLAIMER:  The five POSSE macros and users' guide are provided to SAS users who wish to perform global exploratory analyses near the
beginning of a data analysis.  However, they assume a working knowledge of correspondence analysis and homogeneity analysis.  In addition,
CDC and NIOSH do not warrant the reliability or accuracy of the software, graphics or text.

The SAS macros for the POSSE methods are ‘Read-Only’ files with a date of 05/01/2019.  After downloading, the read-only property can
be removed and researchers can, if they wish, then modify the macros for their own use.  However, they are asked to acknowledge this
while using the following attribution.  Thank you.
